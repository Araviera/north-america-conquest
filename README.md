# Welcome to North America Conquest! ðŸŒŽ
This is my Stanford University's code in place graduation project.
It should highlight my software engineering skills.

# software development lifecycle
For this game, I used an iterative development approach inspired by Agile. Here's how I worked:

1. Planning: I started with high-level planning, outlining the game concept, core features (countries, enemies, battle system), and initial goals.

2. Short Sprints: Instead of developing everything at once, I broke the project into smaller, achievable chunks. Each mini-sprint would focus on specific features or improvements.

3. Toolset: I gathered the necessary tools (IDE, Git, notetaking) to manage the project efficiently.

4. Testing & Feedback: Throughout development, I playtested the game and actively sought player feedback. This helped refine the direction and identify areas for improvement.

5. Iteration & Evaluation: Based on feedback and testing results, I continuously evaluated progress and re-prioritized features for future sprints.


## Gameplay
- **Recruit Miners**: Hire miners to extract valuable gold and fund your nation.
- **Research and Development**: Invest in research to gain a technological edge over your rivals.
- **Engage in Battle**: attack and defend your territory from adversaries.
- **Persistent Progress**: Your game progress is saved continuously, so you can pick up right where you left offâ€”unless it's game over, or you decide to reset.

Enjoy!
